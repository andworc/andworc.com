Welcome to _Andworc_, my name is Oswine, and this is the beginning of a journey
to create a game development house focused on producing works that share our European
heritage in a new medium. I want to develop software that reintroduces our people
to that invaluable heritage left to us: our history, traditions, and cultures.

As one can likely infer, I am a conservative, traditionl man, a seeming rarity
within this field; I wish to create a welcoming, unapologetic space for
like-minded fellows: out from the cold of an antagonistic industry, which is
why I make no illusions about my nature.

As an Englishman, with Heathen sympathies, my foremost interest lies with the
Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic people, though I wish for this work to provide
worth for Europeans broadly, particularly to Northern Europeans.

_More to follow._

Farewell,<br/>
Oswine
